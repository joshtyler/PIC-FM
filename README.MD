#PIC-FM

A digitally controlled FM project using a PIC18LF6490 microcontroller and AR1010 I2C FM Tuner IC.

This was a group project created for a university lab class. I was primarily responsible for the creation of the code.

The system is designed to interface with a Varitronix 3x8 segment LCD, but any similar LCD could be substituted with minor code changes.

The microcontroller can take advantage of advanced features of the FM tuner, such as the autotune functionality. It can also display pre-programmed station names, by scrolling text along the LCD.

## Notes

The code for the Project is provided as an MPLAB X Project.
